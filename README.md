# Scalable Job-Harvesting System

 architecture for building a high-throughput, AI-enhanced **job-harvesting** platform. This system ingests job postings from various sources, processes them (both in real-time and batch modes), stores them, and exposes them via APIs or UIs—all while leveraging AI to automate tasks like adaptive scraping, data cleaning, and deduplication.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

### 1.1 Overview

This system gathers (scrapes) job postings from diverse sources — websites, APIs, and external partners. It then processes the data through streaming and batch pipelines before storing it for consumption through APIs or user interfaces.


- **Scraping Engines (Puppeteer, Selenium, Playwright)** for web-based harvesting.
- **API Connectors** for sites offering structured job data endpoints.
- **Queueing System (Redis Queue)** to handle high-volume ingestion and decouple producers from consumers.
- **Celery Workers** to process and execute tasks in distributed queue
