# Scalable Job-Harvesting System

A reference architecture for building a high-throughput, AI-enhanced **job-harvesting** platform. This system ingests job postings from various sources, processes them (both in real-time and batch modes), stores them, and exposes them via APIs or UIs—all while leveraging Agentic AI to automate tasks like adaptive scraping, data cleaning, and deduplication.
